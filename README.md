Python code for solving Couette's flow using 3rd order Runge-Kutta method for time integration and 2nd order finite difference method for viscous term discretization. The lines in 'parameters.txt' correspond to: distance between the plates (h), top plate speed (u_t) and viscosity (nu). For different numbers of iterations, results are plotted and compared with the analytical solution. Deviations are also calculated. Results for each number of iterations are stored in separate files.
